<h1 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h1>
<p>My name is Sam Scheele! I&rsquo;m a master&rsquo;s student in computer science, specializing in robotics and computational perception.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-this-place">What is this place?</h1>
<p>This is a place for me to write about technical stuff. My current plan is for said stuff to be pretty much entirely math, computer science, and engineering concepts, but I also like to get my hands dirty doing woodworking and electronics projects. Depending on my motivation to write those up and how well I think they&rsquo;ll translate to a blog format (currently, it seems to me that videos are better for physical things), the blog might end up evolving to cover projects of all sorts.</p>
<h1 id="wow-your-blog-is-so-good-i-want-to-pay-you-a-lot-of-money-to-work-on-cool-projects-how-can-i-get-in-touch-with-you">Wow, your blog is so good I want to pay you a lot of money to work on cool projects, how can I get in touch with you?</h1>
<p>Understandable, I also want for you to do that. You can email me at {my first name}.{my last name} [at] yahoo dot com. You can also feel free to get in touch if you have something cool but private you want to talk about. For pretty much anything else related to this blog (eg: corrections or requests for topics), you should open an issue on this site&rsquo;s GitHub.</p>
