<p>I took a break from learning Rust to make <a href="https://github.com/sscheele/sys_anim">a repository of animated plots</a> using Matplotlib.</p>
<p>I was initially going to use Rust for this, but ended up deciding not to - though <a href="https://github.com/plotters-rs/plotters/">plotters</a> looks very cool! This is mostly because I came to the conclusion that no Rust library is mature enough to do what I want, which is to make nice-looking stuff for one-off use cases like presentations. A Rust solution would probably be faster and more maintainable, but these Python scripts are simple and easy to extend, which is a better value proposition for one-off projects.</p>
<p>This repository got started when I realized that, completely without my knowledge, someone upgraded Matplotlib to have a very intuitive interface for animations. I seem to remember it being awful, but when I checked on it, it was as simple as passing a function argument to <code>plt.FuncAnimation</code> and handling the rest yourself.</p>
<p>Maybe the coolest thing I found is that you can overlay graphs on videos! We can do this by noticing that Matplotlib allows you to write output to arbitrary buffers, meaning that we can get a raw RGBA pixel array. I can&rsquo;t take the credit for this, I found it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7821518/save-plot-to-numpy-array">on StackOverflow</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">io_buf = io.BytesIO()
fig.savefig(io_buf, format='raw', dpi=DPI)
io_buf.seek(0)
img_arr = np.reshape(np.frombuffer(io_buf.getvalue(), dtype=np.uint8),
                     newshape=(int(fig.bbox.bounds[3]), int(fig.bbox.bounds[2]), -1))
io_buf.close()
</code></pre>
<p>This gives a nice pipeline of load video frame -&gt; do pixel-level art -&gt; overlay graph relevant to frame -&gt; write prettier video. Note that I am not trying to write rendering library! This is an easy way to get nice videos, not a performant way.</p>
