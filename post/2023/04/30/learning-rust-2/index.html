<main>
<p>This week of Rust was focused almost entirely on last week&rsquo;s technique #4, open source contribution! I spent the week working on three issues.</p>
<h2 id="issue-1-documentationhttpsgithubcomhelix-editorhelixissues6691">Issue #1: <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/6691">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>This issue dealt with documenting two specific commands which had been added to Helix as part of a recent update that introduced soft line wrapping. I proposed extending the documentation generator to automatically document all commands, but then it turned out that someone was already doing the same thing (but probably better than I would have), so I just manually updated the docs. A nice first issue, I didn&rsquo;t have to write any code but ended up reading some in order to locate the docstrings, which can only be found in the source right now.</p>
<h2 id="issue-2-restart-language-servers-on-crashhttpsgithubcomhelix-editorhelixissues6398">Issue #2: <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/6398">Restart Language Servers on Crash</a></h2>
<p>I looked into this one a fair bit before deciding that it was too hard for me. They want language servers to restart when they crash, and trying to figure out how to make this happen in Rust was very, very valuable! I learned a ton about asynchronous stuff, which is essential to Rust&rsquo;s design (Rust is supposed to be thread-safe by default). As best I can tell, it would require changing the LS registry from mapping language IDs to <code>Arc&lt;Client&gt;</code>s to <code>Arc&lt;RefCell&lt;Client&gt;&gt;</code>s, then somehow adding a routine to the error handling that would asynchronously use the <code>RefCell</code> to acquire a write-lock on the client, poll <code>Client._process.id()</code> to see if it died, and, if so, restarting the client.</p>
<p>Anyway, even if this wasn&rsquo;t solved, it provided excellent experience navigating large codebases and doing async things in Rust.</p>
<h2 id="issue-3-only-render-graphemes-in-viewporthttpsgithubcomhelix-editorhelixissues4513">Issue #3: <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/4513">Only Render Graphemes in Viewport</a></h2>
<p>Helix doesn&rsquo;t render lines that won&rsquo;t show up in the viewport, but this issue suggests a speed improvement where you also don&rsquo;t render <em>columns</em> which won&rsquo;t show up, which can be helpful when dealing with long lines. Implementing this was easier and only took a few hours one morning, but as it turns out it wasn&rsquo;t very helpful because it&rsquo;s harder to  Still a reasonably good experience and I learned about Rust&rsquo;s very nice labelled loops feature, which lets you do things like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">'outer: loop {
	'inner: loop {
		// ...
		continue 'outer;
		break 'outer;
	}
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="issue-4-use-gitignore-outside-of-git-reposhttpsgithubcomhelix-editorhelixissues6909">Issue #4: <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/6909">Use Gitignore Outside of Git Repos</a></h2>
<p>I just started this one, so I&rsquo;m not counting it, but it does seem pretty easy!</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>I think this week highlights in a number of ways the upsides and downsides of doing open-source contribution to learn a programming language. Open source doesn&rsquo;t mean low standards: people want your contributions to be good. This makes the learning curve incredibly steep - you&rsquo;re reading, and expected to write, high-quality code in a language you aren&rsquo;t very solid on yet. Of the 4 issues I examined, the only one I made a successful PR on didn&rsquo;t require writing any code at all. However, the two coding issues that I didn&rsquo;t end up submitting PRs for were extremely useful as a way to learn in &ldquo;shadow mode,&rdquo; where you try to implement features for yourself even if that doesn&rsquo;t result in code getting committed to the project. There&rsquo;s even a supervised version of this, where you look at past PRs, try to implement the feature for yourself, and then get the feedback of how someone did it in reality.</p>
<p>This might also be a sort of cool way to train LLMs to code. Apparently, a modern issue with this is that all publicly-available code has been exhausted. But has all <em>historically</em> available code been exhausted? There&rsquo;s a huge potential dataset of changes to codebases and English-language descriptions and discussions of those changes.</p>
<h1 id="next-week">Next Week</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll focus somewhat on my most recent github issue and also on #5 from last week&rsquo;s list, Re-Implementing Standard Library Components</p>
