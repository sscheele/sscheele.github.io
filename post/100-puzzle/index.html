<p>Here&rsquo;s a puzzle I found in &ldquo;The Moscow Puzzles&rdquo;, by Boris Kordemsky and Martin Gardner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Person 1 can call any number from 1 to 10. Person 2 can then increment the last called number by any whole number from 1 to 10, then it&rsquo;s Person 1&rsquo;s turn again, and so on. The first person to call 100 wins. Give a strategy that allows Person 1 to win this game every time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take a minute to try and solve it!</p>
<p>A hint here is that it&rsquo;s useful to think about problems like this in terms of invariants. What invariants can Person 1 preserve that allow him to win? One example might be that Person 1 wants to call 100, which is congruent to 0 mod 10. Can we preserve the invariant that Person 1 always calls a number congruent to 0 mod 10?</p>
<p>Yes, but it&rsquo;s not useful! For instance, Person 1 might call 90, and then Person 2 would get to call 100 and win. In fact, we were on the right track, but we chose a number that doesn&rsquo;t adequately take Person 2&rsquo;s moves into account. Let&rsquo;s formalize this a bit: Person 1 needs to find a mod base \(b\) and a number \( n \) such that \(100 \equiv n\ (\mod b)\) <em>and</em> Person 1 can ensure that he will always call number congruent to \(n\) mod \(b\) and Person 2 can <em>never</em> call a congruent number. Person 1 can then call \(n\) as his first move and ensure that all subsequent moves are congruent to \(n\) mod \(b\). We can simplify by asking ourselves an easier, equivalent question: can Person 1 find a number \(b\) such that his move and Person 2&rsquo;s last move always sum to \(b\)?</p>
<p>Clearly, the only possible such number is 11. Using 11 for \(b\), we can see that we must use 1 for \(n\), because \(100 \equiv 1\ (\mod 11)\). Person 1 calls 1, and after 9 pairs of moves which sum to 11, Person 1 will also call 100.</p>
<p>Kordemsky phrases the answer differently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To call 100, first call 89. To call 89, first call 78, 67, 56&hellip; starting with 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is more concise, but it also doesn&rsquo;t scale so well. For instance, it takes me just a moment to tell you that if the first person to call 500 wins (instead of 100), then Person 1 can always win by starting on 5, because 500 is congruent to 5 mod 11.</p>
