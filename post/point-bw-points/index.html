<p>Here&rsquo;s another short post on a problem I solved today. Suppose you have a point and want to see if it&rsquo;s between two other points. If you&rsquo;re working in a 2D space, you can use a solution along the lines of <a href="https://bryceboe.com/2006/10/23/line-segment-intersection-algorithm/">this one</a> from Bryce Boe, but it&rsquo;s not obvious how it would generalize to higher dimensions.</p>
<p>So I thought I&rsquo;d take a different approach: what do we mean when we say a point is &ldquo;between two points?&rdquo; It can help to visualize the set of points between, say, (0,0) and (1,1):</p>
<p>INEQ1</p>
<p>We can see here how &ldquo;between two points&rdquo; is equivalent to &ldquo;between two lines&rdquo;, or, more generally, &ldquo;between two hyperplanes.&rdquo; Further, both of these hyperplanes are defined by the same normal vector: the one that runs between the two &rsquo;endpoints&rsquo; we&rsquo;re checking! So, we want to define a linear inequality $\min(f(l), f(r)) &lt; f(x) &lt; \max(f(l), f(r))$, where $l$ and $r$ are our endpoints, and $f$ is somehow derived from our difference vector.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can actually derive $f$ by inspection if we remember from algebra class that plane ineqalities can be easily defined by their normals! For instance, if your normal vector is $(1,2)$ or $x + 2y$, then the plane inequality is $c_{min} &lt; x + 2y &lt; c_{max}$. We can find the values for $c_{min}$ and $c_{max}$ by just plugging in the endpoints. So we arrive at a very simple method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

def is_between(x, endpts):
	l, r = endpts
	diff = r - l
	cl, cr = np.dot(l, diff), np.dot(r, diff)
	f_x = np.dot(x, diff)
	if cl &lt; cr:
		return cl &lt; f_x &lt; cr
	else:
		return cr &lt; f_x &lt; cl
</code></pre>
<p>But we can actually do better by taking advantage of the identity:</p>
<p>$$\cos(\angle(a, b)) = \dfrac{a \cdot b}{|a||b|}$$</p>
<p>If the cosine of the angle between the vectors from each endpoint to:</p>
<ol>
<li>The other endpoint</li>
<li>The point of interest</li>
</ol>
<p>Is positive, then the point of interest is between the endpoints! Since we only care whether it&rsquo;s positive, we can actually drop the denominator and get an ultra-minimal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

def is_between(x, endpts):
	l, r = endpts
	x = np.asarray(x)
	l, r = np.asarray(l), np.asarray(r)
	return np.dot(x-l, r-l) &gt; 0 and np.dot(x-r, l-r) &gt; 0
</code></pre>
<p>Not only did we make this way shorter, we also dropped a call to <code>np.dot</code>! We did this at the expense of up to 3 additional subtractions, but subtraction is way cheaper than multiplication.</p>
