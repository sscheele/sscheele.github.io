      <description>I like to have the ability to run things locally on my computer, but getting LaTeX to work has always been a pain because of the package system. It tells me that I&amp;rsquo;m missing packages, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t on the AUR and I&amp;rsquo;ve never been willing to invest the time to figure out how to install them. But now that I&amp;rsquo;m working on my thesis I devoted the time to figure it out and I&amp;rsquo;m posting it here so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to my Kalman filtering notes! In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll first back up and talk about when and why we would want to use a Kalman filter, and we&amp;rsquo;ll go all the way to deriving a filter with the same properties as KF.
Kalman Filter Setup and Motivation Suppose you&amp;rsquo;re designing a satellite that needs to estimate its location in space very precisely. The two most obvious ways to do this are to use GPS and to infer your location by measuring it relative to background stars.</description>

      <description>This is the first in a series of posts on the Kalman Filter! Over the series, we&amp;rsquo;ll first derive a filter with the same properties as the KF, then the KF itself, and finally more advanced variants such as EKF and UKF.
I&amp;rsquo;ll assume for this series that you have some knowledge of linear algebra and probability theory. However, a quick refresher never hurt anyone, so the remainder of this post will cover that.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a puzzle I found in &amp;ldquo;The Moscow Puzzles&amp;rdquo;, by Boris Kordemsky and Martin Gardner:
Person 1 can call any number from 1 to 10. Person 2 can then increment the last called number by any whole number from 1 to 10, then it&amp;rsquo;s Person 1&amp;rsquo;s turn again, and so on. The first person to call 100 wins. Give a strategy that allows Person 1 to win this game every time</description>

      <description>Hello, world!
I made this site based on a very minimal hugo theme. Despite the fact that this theme is only 150 lines of code, I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand it! There are two reasons for this:
I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with Hugo (the static site generator I&amp;rsquo;m using) or really web development There seem to be a lot of magic constants in hugo that I don&amp;rsquo;t like. I think this was part of an effort to make Hugo &amp;ldquo;creator-friendly&amp;rdquo; by hiding complexity from users of the tool.</description>
