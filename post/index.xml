      <description>In my last Kalman filtering post, we derived a LUMVE (Linear, Unbiased, Minimum-Variance) estimator for a static object. Then, we showed that we could use that general estimator to make an estimator that incorporates a priori information (a prior best guess) by sort of pretending our prior guess was a measurement. You might be able to guess where we go next: if we can find the covariance matrix $\hat{P}$ for that estimator, then we could take our last estimation and use it as the a priori guess for our next estimation.</description>

      <title>Double and Triple Exponential Smoothing: Part 1</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have some time-series data and you want to smooth it out and maybe run some prediction. You could design a FIR filter or something, but FIR filters involve a number of design decisions. What will your cutoff points be? What window size will you use? How will you handle data before your first full window? But, perhaps most importantly: if your data starts to move, how will you handle it?</description>

      <title>Learning Rust: Week 4</title>

      <description>This will be the last installment in my series on learning Rust, in which I give some notes on Cow. I finished re-implementing Cow for myself and found some performance stuff that surprised me! As my main testbed, I&amp;rsquo;m using this function:
fn test_speed() { use rand::{thread_rng, Rng}; use std::time::{Duration, Instant}; use std::vec::*; let mut rng = thread_rng(); let pos_nums: Vec&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt; = (1..1000000).collect(); let neg_nums: Vec&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt; = (-50..999950).collect(); let t_start = Instant::now(); // naive method for _ in 1.</description>

      <title>Animated Plot Collection</title>

      <description>I took a break from learning Rust to make a repository of animated plots using Matplotlib.
I was initially going to use Rust for this, but ended up deciding not to - though plotters looks very cool! This is mostly because I came to the conclusion that no Rust library is mature enough to do what I want, which is to make nice-looking stuff for one-off use cases like presentations. A Rust solution would probably be faster and more maintainable, but these Python scripts are simple and easy to extend, which is a better value proposition for one-off projects.</description>

      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on implementing my own version of Cow, which I&amp;rsquo;m increasingly convinced is helpful even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t made much progress on it.
What I&amp;rsquo;ve Done Rust&amp;rsquo;s Smart Pointers and Cow Rust has raw pointers that you can pass around the way you&amp;rsquo;d pass around C pointers, but you&amp;rsquo;re not supposed to use them except in very specific circumstances. Raw pointers in Rust are unsafe and sort of ruin the point of following all of the ownership rules.</description>

      <description>This week of Rust was focused almost entirely on last week&amp;rsquo;s technique #4, open source contribution! I spent the week working on three issues.
Issue #1: Documentation This issue dealt with documenting two specific commands which had been added to Helix as part of a recent update that introduced soft line wrapping. I proposed extending the documentation generator to automatically document all commands, but then it turned out that someone was already doing the same thing (but probably better than I would have), so I just manually updated the docs.</description>

      <description>This is the first in (hopefully) a series of posts about my efforts to learn Rust! The goal is to track my progress and maybe see what techniques work better/worse.
Thoughts on Rust Rust is a very cool language and definitely worth learning, if you already know C. If you don&amp;rsquo;t already know C, I think it would probably be a lot more frustrating. This is because a lot of Rust&amp;rsquo;s design, such as the ownership system, is based on high-level principles which are designed to eliminate problems you&amp;rsquo;d encounter in C.</description>

      <title>Point Bw Points</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s another short post on a problem I solved today. Suppose you have a point and want to see if it&amp;rsquo;s between two other points. If you&amp;rsquo;re working in a 2D space, you can use a solution along the lines of this one from Bryce Boe, but it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious how it would generalize to higher dimensions.
So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a different approach: what do we mean when we say a point is &amp;ldquo;between two points?</description>

      <description>I wanted to make a mini-post with a sort of cute problem I solved today: let&amp;rsquo;s say you want your robotic arm to travel from one joint-space position to another, but along the way you want it to follow a Cartesian end-effector trajectory. This actually isn&amp;rsquo;t such an unrealistic scenario! You&amp;rsquo;re basically constraining the start and end to be &amp;ldquo;sort of reasonable&amp;rdquo; (something you might want to do, given that 7+dof arms can have weird/slow ik), but you only care about the end effector path in between them, not the whole joint trajectory.</description>

      <description>I recently saw a post on Gwern&amp;rsquo;s blog on an interesting problem in probability and expected value:
A shuffled deck of cards has an equal number of red and black cards. When you draw a red card from the deck, you get \$1, and when you draw a black card you lose \$1. You can stop whenever you want. If the deck has $N$ cards, what is the expected value of playing this game?</description>

      <description>I like to have the ability to run things locally on my computer, but getting LaTeX to work has always been a pain because of the package system. It tells me that I&amp;rsquo;m missing packages, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t on the AUR and I&amp;rsquo;ve never been willing to invest the time to figure out how to install them. But now that I&amp;rsquo;m working on my thesis I devoted the time to figure it out and I&amp;rsquo;m posting it here so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget.</description>

      <title>Kalman Filtering 1: Motivation and LUMVE</title>

      <description>Welcome back to my Kalman filtering notes! In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll first back up and talk about when and why we would want to use a Kalman filter, and we&amp;rsquo;ll go all the way to deriving a filter with the same properties as KF.
Kalman Filter Setup and Motivation Suppose you&amp;rsquo;re designing a satellite that needs to estimate its location in space very precisely. The two most obvious ways to do this are to use GPS and to infer your location by measuring it relative to background stars.</description>

      <description>This is the first in a series of posts on the Kalman Filter! Over the series, we&amp;rsquo;ll first derive a filter with the same properties as the KF, then the KF itself, and finally more advanced variants such as EKF and UKF.
I&amp;rsquo;ll assume for this series that you have some knowledge of linear algebra and probability theory. However, a quick refresher never hurt anyone, so the remainder of this post will cover that.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a puzzle I found in &amp;ldquo;The Moscow Puzzles&amp;rdquo;, by Boris Kordemsky and Martin Gardner:
Person 1 can call any number from 1 to 10. Person 2 can then increment the last called number by any whole number from 1 to 10, then it&amp;rsquo;s Person 1&amp;rsquo;s turn again, and so on. The first person to call 100 wins. Give a strategy that allows Person 1 to win this game every time</description>

      <description>Hello, world!
I made this site based on a very minimal hugo theme. Despite the fact that this theme is only 150 lines of code, I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand it! There are two reasons for this:
I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with Hugo (the static site generator I&amp;rsquo;m using) or really web development There seem to be a lot of magic constants in hugo that I don&amp;rsquo;t like. I think this was part of an effort to make Hugo &amp;ldquo;creator-friendly&amp;rdquo; by hiding complexity from users of the tool.</description>
