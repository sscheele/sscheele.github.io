<p>I recently had my laptop&rsquo;s SSD fail, and it took me a long time to get back up and running - partially because I tried to install and run Wayland instead of X (which worked out reasonably well - I ended up switching back to X mostly because OnlyOffice was super slow on Wayland/sway, but it seems to me like Wayland is coming within a couple of years!). But a lot of the issue was that I hadn&rsquo;t made a proper backup in years, so I needed to remember how I had set up a ton of different software. I&rsquo;d been using CloneZilla, which is basically a live disk that lets you clone entire disks/partitions, for backups, but there were some problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>No incremental backups, so unchanged files would be duplicated every time. This made backups take longer and take up more space.</li>
<li>Unencrypted by default</li>
<li>Restoring backups to disks or partitions of different sizes often didn&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>Combination of slow and done from a live disk meant that my laptop was unusable for hours during backups</li>
</ul>
<p>The upshot of this, and the biggest problem of all, was that I wasn&rsquo;t actually using my backup software. After looking into alternatives, I&rsquo;ve decided to switch to <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>. The big disadvantage of restic is that it&rsquo;s designed to back up files, not systems. Restic (unlike, for example, timeshift) doesn&rsquo;t have a concept of &ldquo;configuration&rdquo; or &ldquo;bootloader&rdquo;, so to the extent that it&rsquo;s capable of backing these things up, it is backing up files on the disk. So when this hard drive fails, restoring my system won&rsquo;t be trivially easy. But in exchange for that, I get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encrypted by default</li>
<li>Incremental backups are supported and work well</li>
<li>Network backups supported</li>
<li>Backups can be stopped at any point with Ctrl-C and resumed automatically!</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on my tests, I suspect that each incremental backup will take up something like 5 minutes and 100 MB, assuming I haven&rsquo;t downloaded any huge files. To make creating backups (and eventually restoring them) easier, I wrote a script that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uses <code>yay -Qqe</code> and <code>yay -Qqm</code> to export lists of explicitly installed repo and aur packages</li>
<li>Uses restic to back up my home and /etc directories (hopefully backing up /etc and ~/.config captures most of my configuration files)</li>
<li>Cleans up backups older than 1 year old</li>
</ol>
<p>The script is adapted from the Arch Linux wiki, and I&rsquo;ve included it below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

if [[ -n $(pgrep 'restic' | grep 'restic backup') ]]; then
  echo 'restic is already running...' 1&gt;&amp;2
  exit 0
fi

if [ ! -d &quot;$1&quot; ]; then
  echo &quot;Backup directory not found: $1&quot;
  exit 1
fi
BACKUP_DIR=&quot;$1&quot;

set -e
set -v

######
# Backup package list
######
PKG_DIR=&quot;$BACKUP_DIR/packages&quot;
# set $date to string date
printf -v date '%(%Y-%m-%d)T' -1
# export only &quot;official&quot; packages
yay -Qqe | grep -v &quot;$(yay -Qqm)&quot; &gt; &quot;$PKG_DIR/$date.official.txt&quot;
# export aur packages
yay -Qqm &gt; &quot;$PKG_DIR/$date.aur.txt&quot;

######
# Restic backup
######

export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=&quot;$BACKUP_DIR/restic&quot;
export RESTIC_PASSWORD='ResticBackup123'
export RESTIC_COMPRESSION='auto'
export RESTIC_CACHE_DIR=~/.cache/restic
export RESTIC_READ_CONCURRENCY=4

mkdir -p &quot;${RESTIC_CACHE_DIR}&quot;

restic unlock 
restic backup /etc /home/sam --exclude-file=/etc/restic/excludes.txt --tag scheduled --exclude='**/mnt'
restic check --with-cache --read-data-subset=5G
restic forget --prune --keep-within 1y
</code></pre>
<p>This script looks for a file containing patterns to exclude from the backup, which doesn&rsquo;t come with restic: <code>/etc/restic/excludes.txt</code>. Mine looks like:</p>
<pre><code>**/*cache
**/*Cache
**/lost+found
**/tmp
**/.Trash*
**/Trash*
**/trash*
**/.trash*
**/.venv
</code></pre>
