<p>I recently got a new laptop and had to reinstall latex. The default way to do this is to install TeXLive with pacman, which is packaged into a set of groups which contain anything from the most basic installation (<code>texlive-basic</code>) to a virtually exhaustive installation (some combination of <code>texlive-latexextra</code>, <code>texlive-fontsextra</code> and a few others). I initially opted to install <code>texlive-latexrecommended</code>, until I tried to compile a document and realized I was missing <code>fullpage.sty</code>. This was only available in <code>texlive-latexextra</code>, and I also needed a font that was only present in <code>texlive-fontsextra</code>. So to get about 200 kB of .sty files, I was supposed to install &gt;2 GB of packages.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I learned about MikTeX and made the switch. MikTeX, as I understand it, wraps traditional LaTeX tools like <code>pdflatex</code> in a script that detects missing .sty files and installs them (automatically, if so configured). Their motto is &ldquo;Just enough TeX.&rdquo; The installation requires a few steps, so I&rsquo;m documenting here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install miktex from the AUR. It has openjdk as a dependency, which is a little annoying but you&rsquo;ll probably need it eventually and somehow the entire JDK is smaller than <code>texlive-latexextra</code>.</li>
<li><code>miktex-console</code> will not be available in your PATH, but it is located in <code>/opt/miktex/bin/miktex-console</code>. Run it. It will walk you through completing your installation and warn you to add your binary directory (it uses $HOME/bin, which is a bit annoying) to your PATH in your <code>.bash_profile</code> (in my case, <code>.zprofile</code>). Also tab over to the &lsquo;Updates&rsquo; section and click &lsquo;Check for updates&rsquo;. You can also select whether to allow, prompt, or disallow on-the-fly installations of missing packages in the &lsquo;Settings&rsquo; page (I started out with prompt and quickly changed to allow). You are now ready to use miktex, assuming you don&rsquo;t have any other installations of TeX that come before it in your PATH.</li>
<li>If you try to install something like Texmaker, you&rsquo;ll run into an annoying issue where it doesn&rsquo;t know you have LaTeX already and tries to install <code>texlive-basic</code> as a dependency. Don&rsquo;t be fooled into installing <em>twice</em> as much TeX as you need! To prevent this, we can install a dummy pkgbuild that claims to provide LaTeX. Here it is:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>pkgname=texlive-dummy
pkgver=1.0
pkgrel=1
pkgdesc=&quot;Placeholder to stop TeX installs&quot;
arch=(i686 x86_64)
license=('custom')
provides=('tetex' 'texlive-bin' 'texlive-core' 'texinfo' 'texlive-basic')
conflicts=('tetex' 'texlive-bin' 'texlive-core' 'texlive-basic')
build() {
/bin/true
}
package() {
/bin/true
}
</code></pre>
<p>A quick <code>makepkg -si</code> and your LaTeX dependencies are forever satisfied.</p>
<p>Note: it is possible to install something like &ldquo;Just enough TeX&rdquo; using <code>tlmgr</code> manually, which I would normally be perfectly happy to do. I&rsquo;m using MikTeX because the version of <code>tlmgr</code> that ships with MikTeX is broken; the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/TeX_Live#tlmgr">Arch wiki</a> describes a manual process for fixing it which must be re-run every time you update <code>texlive-basic</code>. This seems a little absurd to me, even if it does eliminate the OpenJDK dependency.</p>
