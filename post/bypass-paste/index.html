<p>I recently had to pay a tax bill online, but it turned out that my town&rsquo;s bill payment website has one of those incredibly annoying JavaScript forms that blocks pasting into the bank account number field. This is so, so stupid. I genuinely don&rsquo;t understand what benefit they think this could possibly offer. They force me to type it in manually, and then, because typing things in manually is an error-prone process, the next field forces me to type in the whole number manually again! You know what&rsquo;s not an error-prone process? <em>Copying and pasting the account number.</em></p>
<p>The first thing I tried to get around this was installing an extension called &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Fuck with Paste.&rdquo; Charmingly, the name of the extension is starred out (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t F*** with Paste&rdquo;) in the Chrome web store, but not in the Firefox web store. I prefer Firefox in any event, and in this case the name of the Firefox extension better reflected my level of frustration with the website. Anyway, I got the extension, which promptly&hellip; broke paste everywhere in the browser. Uninstall.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Linux lets you do things yourself! I usually run Wayland, so I installed <code>wl-clipboard</code>, which lets you manipulate the Wayland clipboard, and <code>wtype</code>, which lets you emulate keystrokes. Then I added a line to my Sway config:</p>
<pre><code>bindsym $mod+Shift+v exec wl-paste --no-newline | wtype -
</code></pre>
<p>(The <code>--no-newline</code> suppresses <code>wl-paste</code>&rsquo;s puzzling default behavior of adding a newline to strings that didn&rsquo;t have them).</p>
<p>And that was it! Now I can bypass paste restrictions anywhere, more or less regardless of how they&rsquo;re implemented.</p>
