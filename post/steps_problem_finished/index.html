<main>
<p>At the technical interview for my first college internship, I was asked to solve a few simple programming problems. The last one was this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can move forward in increments of one step or three steps. In how many different ways can you reach $n$ steps?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got completely <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a> by this question. Answering it is easy; there is a simple DP solution (below, using Python&rsquo;s <code>functools.cache</code> to do DP for me):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from functools import cache

@cache
def steps_dp(n):
    if n in [0, 1]:
        return 1
    elif n &lt; 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return steps_dp(n-1) + steps_dp(n-3)
</code></pre>
<p>The intuition is that you can travel $n$ steps by either traveling $n-1$ steps and then one more, or $n-3$ steps and then three more.</p>
<p>But the thing that nerd sniped me was trying to find a constant-time, analytical solution to this problem. In fact, I was thinking so hard about that that I completely forgot to give the DP solution and almost missed out on the internship. Over the last six years or so, I periodically remember the steps problem and spend ten minutes or so thinking about it. I spent an hour or so with ChatGPT seeing if it could solve it using generating functions (it couldn&rsquo;t, at the time). But a couple of days ago, I figured it out - and it&rsquo;s actually very simple!</p>
<p>As an intermediate step which makes the solution more clear, note that, as with many DP algorithms, you can create a slightly more memory-efficient version of the above solution by getting the answer constructively instead of recursively:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def steps_constructive(n):
    if n in [0, 1]:
        return 1
    elif n &lt; 0:
        return 0
    curr_n = 2
    last_buf = [1,1,1]
    while curr_n &lt; n:
        next_n = last_buf[0] + last_buf[2]
        last_buf = last_buf[1:] + [next_n]
        curr_n += 1
    return last_buf[-1]
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we notice that we don&rsquo;t need to store <em>all</em> values of the steps function, only the last three. Here, the intuition is that you can &ldquo;advance&rdquo; the buffer one item (from leading item $n$ to $n+1$) using only the last three items (and actually only two of those, but you need to store all three because the middle item is needed to properly advance the buffer).</p>
<p>Mathematically, we notice that the advancement operator we defined in this function is linear; it is represented by the matrix:</p>
<p>$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>The initial state is $\begin{bmatrix}1 1 1\end{bmatrix}^T$ (encoding that there is one way to reach $n=0,1,2$, and by happy coincidence giving a correct value of 2 for n=3), so to advance by $k$ steps we would simply find
$A^k \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}^T$. But of course, that isn&rsquo;t so simple, because exponentiating a matrix is not always a fast operation.</p>
<p>In this case, though, we can verify by inspection that $A$ is a nonsingular matrix, meaning that it can be diagonalized by its eigenvector decomposition. So we will find $P$, the eigenvector matrix of $A$, and $D$, the diagonal matrix of $A$&rsquo;s corresponding eigenvalues. This is not always fast (in general, the eigenvector decomposition is $O(n^3)$), but it only needs to be done once, and in our case the matrix has a constant size that does not vary with the input, so we can consider this a constant-time operation. Another way to think of this is that we could manually perform the decomposition ourselves and write the algorithm as a formula using only arithmetic and no linear algebra. Of course, that would be inelegant. The full solution looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def steps_analytical(n):
    if n in [0, 1]:
        return 1
    elif n &lt; 0:
        return 0
        
    A = np.array([[1,0,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]])
    evals, P = np.linalg.eig(A)
    D = np.diag(evals)
    P_inv = np.linalg.inv(P)
    start_vec = np.array([1,1,1]).reshape((3,1))
    adv_matr = P @ np.power(D, n-2) @ P_inv
    end_vec = adv_matr @ start_vec
    return np.round(end_vec[0], decimals=3)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this actually does a very good job of not running into floating-point errors; the <code>np.round</code> is there to showcase this. While the DP-based solutions are $O(n)$, this analytical solution is for all purposes $O(1)$ time and memory (technically, even raising integers to the $n$ power has a time complexity of $\log n$, but it&rsquo;s a tremendously fast operation).</p>
<p>And with that, I&rsquo;m free of my years-long sporadic obsession! I hope this was a fun little application of linear algebra for you. As an exercise, you can do the Fibonacci sequence in the same way!</p>
