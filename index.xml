      <description>This is the first in a series of posts on the Kalman Filter! Over the series, we&amp;rsquo;ll first derive a filter with the same properties as the KF, then the KF itself, and finally more advanced variants such as EKF and UKF.
I&amp;rsquo;ll assume for this series that you have some knowledge of linear algebra and probability theory. However, a quick refresher never hurt anyone, so the remainder of this post will cover that.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a puzzle I found in &amp;ldquo;The Moscow Puzzles&amp;rdquo;, by Boris Kordemsky and Martin Gardner:
Person 1 can call any number from 1 to 10. Person 2 can then increment the last called number by any whole number from 1 to 10, then it&amp;rsquo;s Person 1&amp;rsquo;s turn again, and so on. The first person to call 100 wins. Give a strategy that allows Person 1 to win this game every time</description>

      <description>Hello, world!
I made this site based on a very minimal hugo theme. Despite the fact that this theme is only 150 lines of code, I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand it! There are two reasons for this:
I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with Hugo (the static site generator I&amp;rsquo;m using) or really web development There seem to be a lot of magic constants in hugo that I don&amp;rsquo;t like. I think this was part of an effort to make Hugo &amp;ldquo;creator-friendly&amp;rdquo; by hiding complexity from users of the tool.</description>
